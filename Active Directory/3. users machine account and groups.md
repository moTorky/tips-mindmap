### Users
> **why u need to get user access in AD ?**
> active directory users can be configured as basically read-only users who have read access to most of the environment (which are the permissions a standard Domain User receives)

##### User account types:
1. local systems (not joined to AD); such
	1. administrator, guest, authority/system , for more about [Microsoft users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/local-accounts )
2. Domain Users 
	1. which grant a person or a program (such as a system service) access to a Domain Service
	2. can used to log into any host in the domain,  check out this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-accounts) for more details
	3. lst of important accounts
		1. `KRBTGT` an account acts as a service account for the Key Distribution service providing authentication and access for domain resources
			compromise this account led to unconstrained access to the domain.

**Domain User Attributes**

| `UserPrincipalName` UPN | primary logon name (email)     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ObjectGUID              | unique identifier of the user. |
|                         |                                |
##### Administrators and UAC
 - **User Account Control (UAC)** over local administrators (except for the default Administrator account). By default, local administrators won't be able to remotely connect to a machine and perform administrative tasks unless using an interactive session through RDP
 - Domain accounts with local administration privileges won't be subject to the same treatment and will be logged in with full administrative privileges.
----
### Machines 
-  Domain joined Machine
	- a user in the domain can log in and access resources from any host joined to the domain, not just the one they work on
	- *note that a machine account (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level access) in an AD environment will have most of the same rights as a standard domain user account.* 
	**no need for user cred RCE, or SSH will be enough for enum AD ** :) 
-  Non-Domain joined Machine
	like normal computer, note that computers in a `workgroup` are not managed by domain policy.
----
### Groups
groups use for easy permission management, and  have two fundamental characteristics: `type` and `scope`
#### Group Types:
`group type` defines the group's purpose
- `security`:  for ease of assigning permissions and rights, where All users added to a security group will inherit any permissions assigned to the group
- `distribution`: used by email applications
##### Group Scopes:
`group scope` shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest
1. Domain Local Group
	- used to manage permissions to domain resources
	- **`CAN` contain users from `OTHER` domains, Global Groups, Universal Groups, and other Domain Local Groups (from any trusted domain)**
	- **Local groups can be nested into (contained within) other local groups but `NOT` within global groups.**
	- can used to Grant access to a shared folder in Domain A for users from Domain B
2. Global Group
	- can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`
	- only contain accounts from same domain
3. Universal Group
	- can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`
	- universal groups are stored in the Global Catalog (GC)
	
> a user may inherit privileges not assigned directly to their account or even the group they are directly a member of, but rather the group that their group is a member of.
> [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) are particularly useful in uncovering privileges that a user may inherit through one or more nestings of groups.

### BloodHound output explaination
![[Pasted image 20241223232927.png]]
`DCorner` is not a direct member of `Helpdesk Level 1`, their membership in `Help Desk` grants them the same privileges that any member of `Helpdesk Level 1` has. In this case, the privilege would allow them to add a member to the `Tier 1 Admins` group (`GenericWrite`). If this group confers any elevated privileges in the domain, it would likely be a key target for a penetration tester. Here, we could add our user to the group and obtain privileges that members of the `Tier 1 Admins` group are granted, such as local administrator access to one or more hosts that could be used to further access.

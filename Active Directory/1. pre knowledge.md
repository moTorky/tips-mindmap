Before start: AD security prief 
- AD is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default," and it can be easily misconfigured. This weakness can be leveraged to move laterally and vertically within a network and gain unauthorized access.
- ANY user account, regardless of their privilege level, can be used to enumerate the domain and hunt for misconfigurations and flaws thoroughly. including but not limited to:

	|||
	|---|---|
	|Domain Computers|Domain Users|
	|Domain Group Information|Organizational Units (OUs)|
	|Default Domain Policy|Functional Domain Levels|
	|Password Policy|Group Policy Objects (GPOs)|
	|Domain Trusts|Access Control Lists (ACLs)|
- Also, multiple attacks can be performed with only a standard domain user account, One example is the [noPac](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/nopac-a-tale-of-two-vulnerabilities-that-could-end-in-ransomware) attack that was first released in December of 2021,  [PrintNightmare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrintNightmare) , [ZeroLogon](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2021/01/the-story-of-zerologon/)

#### Why Active directory
It simplifies the management of devices and users within a corporate environment. let's suppose your business suddenly grows and now has 157 computers and 320 different users located across four different offices. Would you still be able to <u>manage each computer</u> as a separate entity, manually <u>configure policies</u> for each of the users across the network and provide on-site support for everyone?

---
#### What Active directory
a **Windows domain** is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business, that centralise administration called **Active Directory (AD)**, The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

---
#### Active Directory Objects
AD have main service **Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)** which holds the information of all of the "objects" that exist on your network. 
that objects could be user, service, machine, group, printer, share, others. which saved on A ***[global catalog (GC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/global-catalog)*** 
> `replication service`: after we know that objects saved on GC on DC, replication service used to sync info between DCs 
1. Users
	typically any object that can authenticate to the domain and access **resource**, which could be
		1. normal user
		2. service user: IIS, MySQL user, **have SPN attribute**
2. Machine
	 for every computer that joins the Active Directory domain, a machine object/account will be created
>	 The machine accounts themselves are local administrators on the assigned computer, so if u have Machine's password, then u can use it to login
>	 Machine Account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random characters.
1. Security Group
	are used to **grant permissions over resources**.
	for every user/machine joined the group, they inherit all of the group's privileges.  
	some Groups created by default: Domain Admins, server operators,  a list can found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups)
The machine account name is the computer's name followed by a dollar sign. For example, a machine named `DC01` will have a machine account called `DC01$`.
#### object attributes
- [Security principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals) are anything that the operating system can authenticate (object), that objects have its own unique SID (security identifier), that used by security principal or security group
- [Distinguished Name (DN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as `cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local`)
we called object and their attributes: *`schema`* 
- 
[[3. users machine account and groups]]

**Organizational Units (OUs)**
is a way to classify your objects, where OU have a set of users with similar policy requirement.
so u may have OU for sales and other for accountant and so
Keep in mind that a user can only be a part of a single OU at a time.

there are some OU created by default to group objects:
- **Builtin:** Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
- **Computers:** Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
- **Domain Controllers:** Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
- **Users:** Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
- **Managed Service Accounts:** Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.

>SO OU used to group objects for apply GPOs BUT group object used to assign permissions to access resources
---
#### AD trust relationship
It is common to see multiple domains (or forests) linked together via trust relationships in organizations that perform a lot of acquisitions. It is often quicker and easier to create a trust relationship with another domain/forest than recreate all new users in the current domain.
- note that if trust exist between `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` then users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa
- but a user that is part of `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` would NOT be able to authenticate to machines in the `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local` domain by default, To allow direct communication from `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` and `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local`, another trust would need to be set up.![[Pasted image 20241223132051.png]]

#### AD tools and PowerShell commands
1. ***active directory users and computers***
	used to manage 
	1. users: delete, create, disable, modify
	2. OUs: most important option 
		- **Delegate Control**: where u can set permission for user/s to perform action on that OU such "reset user passwords and force change next login" 
		user with that delegate can use powershell to change password and/or force change next lgoin
		```
		 PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADAccountPassword <username> -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') -Verbose
		 PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity <username> -Verbose
		```
	3. machines: all saved under  "Computers". but it's beast practice to siprate them by type
1. ***Group Policy Management***
	**Group Policy Objects (GPO)**. GPOs are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs.
	so first create GPO and then apply it to OU
#### authentication methods
1. Kerberos 
2. NetNTLM
[[2. authentication]]

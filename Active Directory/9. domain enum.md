##### bloodhound
use collector to make snap shot for domain and use graph theory to visulize the domain
- have new version -> bloodhound CE that run on docker
- tricks to go stelthy with collectors: remove collection methods such RDP, DCOM, PSRemote , localadmin
	```
	invoke-bloodhound -Steatlh

##### MDI (Microsoft Defender for Identity)
primary security solation for secure on-pream AD, which used to secure object identity, and detect anomalies so if user normally access PC and printer then started accessing 10PCs it alert    
so bloodhound can be detected by MDI

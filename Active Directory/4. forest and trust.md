Main components:
- Domain: used to group objects, apply policies(administrative boundary) and share resources and data(replication boundary), manage authentication(auth boundary) for that objects

- Tree: hierarchy of domains in AD DS

- Forest:  collection of one or more domain trees
	- Forest shares a common schema and common GC to enable searching 
		more:	[[1. pre knowledge#Active Directory Objects]]
	- enable trust between all domains
> forest is security boundary: mean that once u get access in a domain, no thing stops u from accessing other forest's domains ![[Pasted image 20241229190914.png]]

but why -> cuz of trust between domains
#### Trust and Trust types
![[Pasted image 20241229192727.png]]
##### **Trust Directionality and Transitivity**

- **One-Way vs. Two-Way:**
    
    - **One-Way Trust:** Only one domain (the trusting domain) permits access to resources from the trusted domain.
    - **Two-Way Trust:** Both domains mutually trust each other, allowing reciprocal resource access.
- **Transitive vs. Non-Transitive:**
    
    - **Transitive Trusts:** Allow a trust relationship to extend to other trusted domains (e.g., Parent-Child, Tree-Root, and Forest Trusts).
    - **Non-Transitive Trusts:** Limit the trust to just the two explicitly connected domains (e.g., External Trusts).

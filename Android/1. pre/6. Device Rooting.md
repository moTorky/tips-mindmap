root is a process by which one obtains “root” or system level access to an android device

manufacturers doesn’t allow user to have this level of access. so they need to exploit a vuln in the device(may u need tow exploits: one to get unprivileged access, and a second to get root)

for access maintenance: copy `su` binary to a location specified in the user’s **PATH** env.. vars like(/system/xbin), then use APP to interface the command execution **`Runtime.exec()`**. (we put `su` in a place can be accessed by our APP like a the PATH that android use to search for binaries)

tow of most apps used to root devices [https://github.com/koush/Superuser](https://github.com/koush/Superuser) and

### custom rooms

other way by unlocked bootloader and replace OS that comes with their device with custom firmware. following are most used:

[LineageOS – LineageOS Android Distribution](https://lineageos.org/)

[OmniROM](https://omnirom.org/)

##### use development devices such
- [android one](https://www.android.com/one/)
- flagship Google pixel devices built for developers.
### Rooting with Magisk
- Its specialty lies in the way the modifications on the system are performed. 
- While other rooting tools alter the actual data on the system partition, Magisk does not. which enables a way to hide the modifications from root-sensitive applications.
- allows using the official Android OTA(***OTA* updates are designed to upgrade the underlying operating system***) upgrades without the need to unroot the device beforehand.

### implications of rooting
once u root a device, any exist app could request root access, and if malicious get that capability their is no limit for that app
##### rooting device can make some issues
most savvy users trust any app or tool in order to root their devices, even the developers of this apps not-malicious they can make mistakes that turn the device into paperweight and make it unusable. but if they are malicious then game over cuz u not only the one how get the root access
### but we need root for our testing purposes u can use emulator(slow) or ADB, but it’s better to have Nexus device on hand
##### ADB

> _note that if u run ADB on emulator that have a google APIs u get shell as user note root, so to get root access in emulator install emulator without google apis_

to get root over ADB: you’ll want to enable Developer Mode and USB debugging on the device in order to use the ADB debugging interface.
##### emulator
Free emulators:
	- Android Virtual Device (AVD) - The official android emulator, distributed with Android Studio. 
	- [Android X86](https://www.android-x86.org/) - An x86 port of the Android code base

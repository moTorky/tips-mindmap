u need to have a way to: examine, build, debug, and run android apps so we need Android Studio IDE.

follow steps to get your Android Studio setup and running, then go a head and make your first app

by using emulators u can get `root` access, without need to use an exploit. also allow tester to test different android APIs version.

we gonna use Nexus 5, Android 5.1.1

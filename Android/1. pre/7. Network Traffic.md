### Risk

there is a risk in transmute data from mobile, because most users used public WIFI üòà

## Solution:

### TLS Usage

all traffic sent form mobile app should send over TLS which provide 3 things confidentially, integrity and authenticity. however u still need validate the certificate

### certificate validation

x.509 certificate verify who is actually performing the encryption is it an attacker or the org, and prevent some attacks such MITM

how organizations create a certificate:

1. the generate public and private key pair
2. send the public key to CA(certificate authority) , along with other infos. this request know as CSR (certificate singing request)
3. CA verify request and validate the digital identity by for hostname by DNS request. and sign it with CA‚Äôs private key
4. CA send signed certificate to the requestor, they can begin to present it to software clients requesting identity verification
5. software clients(mobile apps,..) decides for itself which CA it wants to trust. and tie its public keys
6. know when TLS client needs to validate the certificate it received is authentic:
    1. check the identity stated in the certificate matches the requested DNS hostname
    2. verify that the certificate was properly signed by CA in the software‚Äôs trusted CA list by using CA public key
    3. check expire data

in browser if the verification process failed it generate user error.

since developers must check this 3 steps to validate the certificate most of them ignore it, or ignore the certificate warnings in development phase and production, which impact the user‚Äôs transmitted data

### network controls
##### apps target API Level 23 and before
developer need to create `X509TrustManager`, implement `getAcceptedIssuers` method, and use `SocketFactory`, here's process flow
1. the app get cert and create KeyStore
2. KeyStore used to init `TrustManager` which used by the system to compare CA with one camming from the server 
3. `TrustManager` init `SSLContext` which used in validation process
4. `SSLContext` use `SŸçSLSocketFactory` 

##### apps target API Level 24+
apps that target android 7 (API Level 24) and above can customize their network security setting to trust custom CAs instead of the platform default, which mean even if we install burp certificate proxy can‚Äôt intercept HTTPS traffic. this controls are four types:
1. **Custom Trust Anchors**: developer can limit trusted CA, choose to apply config to specific domain (Domain config), or apply config to all app connections (Base config)
2. **Debug Only Overrides**: Allows developers to debug the app with a local debug server
3. **Cleartext traffic opt-out**: config app to only use HTTPS connections
4. **Certificate pinning**:
###### certificate pinning
after install burp certificate u should be able to capture HTTPS traffic, unless the app implement certificate pinning: mechanism used by app to trust one or set of certificates, public key and/or issuers by hard code it or it's hash in the app

the impact of using certificate pinning on apps: if private key get compromised it would be difficult to update all the clients. if u change your public key, then all clients failed to connect. to bypass that u can use list of trusted keys, if one compromised then u can securely remove/update client

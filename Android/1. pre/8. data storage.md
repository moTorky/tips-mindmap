### Data storage general guideline 
- if app don’t save data securely, this will make vuln called `insecure data storage`
- as soon as data is no longer needed, it should be removed from the device
- the stored data should be encrypted
- Sensitive information disclosure risks:
	- information decryption
	- social engineering
	-  account hijacking
	-  app exploitation with a payment option
- apps can save data into
    - internal storage
        - apps store data in internal storage under `/data/app/<app_package_name>/`, system app installed under `/system/app`
        - created files/shared_pref can have one of 4 permission
            - `MODE_PRIVATE` → the default, only uid can access file
            - `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` →allow all read
            - `MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` → allow all write
            - `MODE_APPEND` → if exist append data
            `MODE_WORLD_READABLE`,`MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` deprecated starting on API level 17. Although newer devices may not be affected by this.
    - external storage `/mnt/sdcard`,`/sdcard`
        - from android 4.3 in order to write on it, app must have `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` PERMISSION, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` from android 11
        - from android 4.4, SD card has a directory structure, which limit access for app to it’s own data [same as using linux structure and uids]
        - for android 10 new feature released called "*Scooped Storage*"  
- data storage shapes:
	- Shared Preferences
		used to save small collections of key-value pairs, written to a plain-text XML file under `/data/data/<package-name>/shared_prefs/`
		```java
		SharedPreferences sharedPref = getSharedPreferences("key", MODE_WORLD_READABLE); 
		SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit(); 
		editor.putString("username", "administrator"); 
		editor.putString("password", "supersecret"); 
		editor.commit();
		```
	- SQLite Databases
		- remember `libariry` layer from android architecture; it have a `SQLite` lib used to mange DBs, used in apps by import `android.database.sqlite`, and implement `SQLiteOpenHelper`. and or using `content provider`
		- DB files saved under `/data/data/<package-name>/databases/`, with other files such: 
		```java
		SQLiteDatabase notSoSecure = openOrCreateDatabase("privateNotSoSecure", MODE_PRIVATE, null); 
		notSoSecure.execSQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts(Username VARCHAR, Password VARCHAR);"); 
		notSoSecure.execSQL("INSERT INTO Accounts VALUES('admin','AdminPass');");
		notSoSecure.close();
		```
		-  you can password-encrypt SQLite databases using [sqlcipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/): `SQLiteDatabase secureDB = SQLiteDatabase.openOrCreateDatabase(database, "password123", null);`
		- most of the time the password/key not saved secure so if one of following ways not used then password store not secure:
			- Asking the user to decrypt the database with a PIN or password once the app is opened (weak passwords and PINs are vulnerable to brute force attacks)
			- Storing the key on the server and allowing it to be accessed from a web service only (so that the app can be used only when the device is online)
	- Firebase Databases 
		- used to store and sync data with a NoSQL(JSON) cloud-hosted database
		-  synchronized in real-time to every connected client
		- available even when the application goes offline
		- Firebase json file saved at: `https://_firebaseProjectName_.firebaseio.com/.json`
		```bash
		python FirebaseScanner.py -p <pathOfAPKFile> 
		python FirebaseScanner.py -f <commaSeparatedFirebaseProjectNames>
		apktool d file.apk -o src_code && gerp "firebaseio" -inR src_code/
		```
	- Realm Databases 
		-  The database and its contents can be encrypted with a key stored in the configuration file
		```java
		//the getKey() method either gets the key from the server or from a KeyStore, or is derived from a password. 
		RealmConfiguration config = new RealmConfiguration.Builder()
		.encryptionKey(getKey())
		.build(); 
		Realm realm = Realm.getInstance(config);
		```
	- Internal Storage 
		- files are containerized by default and cannot be accessed by other apps on the device
		```java
		FileOutputStream fos = null; 
		try { 
			fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); 
			fos.write(test.getBytes()); 
			fos.close(); 
		} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
			e.printStackTrace(); 
		} catch (IOException e) { 
			e.printStackTrace(); 
		}
		```
		- You should check the file mode to make sure that only the app can access the file
		- `grep "FileInputStream" -inR` to find out which files are opened and read within the app.
	- External Storage
		- Files saved to external storage are world-readable. 
		- The user can modify them when USB mass storage is enabled.  more about [MITD](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/androids-man-in-the-disk/)
		```java
		File file = new File (Environment.getExternalFilesDir(), "password.txt");
		String password = "SecretPassword"; 
		FileOutputStream fos; fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
		fos.write(password.getBytes()); 
		fos.close();
		```
		- files stored outside the application folder (`data/data/<package-name>/`) will not be deleted when app uninstalled
	- Keystore
		- Keystore provides a secure container, which can be used by apps to store their private keys, in a way that’s pretty difficult for malicious (unauthorised) users and apps to retrieve.
		- an app can only view, and query, its own keys
		- The Keystore itself is encrypted using the user’s own lockscreen pin/password, hence, when the device screen is locked the Keystore is unavailable
- Additionally, other Android functions that can result in data storage and should be tested include: 
- Logging Functions: 
  Log files can be stored locally when the app is offline and sent to the endpoint once the app is online. android have tow classed to log data `Log`, `logger`. use `adb logcat` to review app's log
- Android Backups: align with backups methods such built-in USB backup facilities ,google “Back Up My Data", android support ADB Backup.
	- ADB Backup Support: if AndroidManifest.xml file have `android:allowBackup=true` the device allows users to back up the application with ADB via `$ adb backup` command
	- When this attribute is unavailable, the `allowBackup` setting is enabled by default
- Processes Memory 
	- it is important that once the relevant sensitive data has been processed, it should be disposed from process memory as quickly as possible
	- The investigation of an application’s memory can be done from memory dumps, and from analyzing the memory in real time via a debugger
- UI Component:
	At certain points in time, the user will have to enter sensitive information into the application. This data may be financial information such as credit card data or user account passwords, or maybe healthcare data. The data may be exposed if the app doesn’t properly mask it while it is being typed
	- Keyboard Caches
		- The keyboard cache stores previously entered information, including sensitive data like passwords or personal messages. If a user selects an input field that typically contains sensitive information (such as a password field or a messaging app's text input field), the keyboard may inadvertently reveal sensitive information by suggesting it as autocomplete options.
	- Screenshots
		- Sensitive data may be exposed if the user deliberately screenshots the application while sensitive data is displayed. A malicious application that is running on the device and able to continuously capture the screen may also expose data.
	- App notifications
		- notifications should never be considered private, because any application running with a `NotificationListenerService` can listen for these notifications to receive them in full and may handle them however it wants.
		- ex: `Joker`, and `Alien` which abuses the `NotificationListenerService` to listen for notifications on the device and then send them to attacker-controlled C2.
		- Commonly this is done to listen to (2FA) codes that appear as notification

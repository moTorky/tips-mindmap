understand Android Build Process help u to understand how all pieces fit together

> to build an android app first: **compile and packaging app**, then: **sign** it
> 
> the difference between apps build for testing and other for release to Google paly is: signing is only for releases APPs

# Compiling Apps

the process start by implementing the Android Asset Packaging tool(aapk) to compile the app resources to R.java, then java compile compile .java file and .aidl files into .class files. the .class files then compiled with the third-party lib into classes.dex by dex, then apkbuilder compile .dex file with other resource into Android package(APK)

.dex files are compiled into native machine code when they are installed on a device, from which they can execute on the _ART_

APK include both the code and the resources(images, vid,..)

then next step is signing process

# APK Structure

> in order to inspect APK u first need to convert it into .zip and the decompress it

after decompress u will find following files and dirs:

- AndroidManifest.xml
    
    this file dictates many security related factures: android version to run app on, required permission to talk to the app,..
    
    AndroidManifest have many elements: `<package>` that have the app name `<uses-sdk>` that has `minSdkVersion` which tell u the oldest version of the OS that app can run on, and `targetSdkVersion` which is the OS version this app was design to run on
    
    > many company want to support as many devices as possible in order to allow the larger number of users. but when u support older OS version, the app inherits this version’s Vulns. so it’s important to strike the right balance between supporting older version and putting the data at risk
    
    `<user-permissions>`, `<activity>`, `<action>`,..
    
- classes.dex we know that the java code written in android studio is compiled into “dex” file (name come from the Dalvik VM). dex file can have up to 63,535 function stored in one file
    
    this is a binary file also like AndroidManifest file
    
- resources.arsc also a binary file that have pre-compiled resources. this file has a limit security impact
    
- /assets here u can find HTML, fonts, mp3, text, images,..
    
- /lib used to storing libraries and pre-compiled code. also it contains directories that represent different combinations of CPU and instruction sets known as Application Binary Interfaces(ABIs).
    
    ex of this directories: _x86 , x86_64 and armabi._ inside this dirs u find linux share object `.so` files
    
    if attacker find a way to modify this files it can used to previlege escalation [Shared Library](https://www.notion.so/Shared-Library-7164f4231d7b4819b4484c2320e9fdd5?pvs=21)
    
- /META-INF this dir related to integrity and authenticity as it have: MANIFEST.MF: have a list of all the resources files and their hashes(SHA1) CERT.RSA: developer’s certificate binary format CERT.SF: a list of the resources and their hashes. including manifest hash
    
- /res have images that not compiled into resources.arsc
    
- Third-Party libs, HTML templets , other custom files and resources
    
    take a look in this files to determine their security impact
    

# code Signing

it’s depend on public-key cryptography and hash function where private kay used to encrypt the hash and the public key used to decrypt it then compare decrypted hash and it’s own hash to verify

the public key is includes in a digital file (x.509 certificate) this cert is self-signed no need for CA

by using private key known only by the developer:

- validate the identity of the user
- ensure the code has not been modified after compiled

the process of signing apk can done by Android Studio IDE, it’s provide tow signing mode one **Debug**(for testing on USB, emulators), other is **Release**(for customer device) or manually:

- first generate the key using `keytool`:
    
    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore foo.keystore -alias myalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000	
    ```
    
- sign using `jarsigner`
    
    ```bash
    jarsigner -sigalg SHAwithRSA -digestalg SAH1 -keystore foo.keystore test.apk myalias
    ```
    
- verify and inspect the signing status of APK as aa whole
    
    ```bash
    jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs com.foo.android.activity.apk
    ```
    
- after sign it and view MANIFEST.MF we see list of files and hashes(base64 encoded)
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/87cf53d8-493b-4081-8fe2-590b5df30cf0/Untitled.png)
    
    to verify a hash of this hashes we use `openssl sha1 -binary <file_path> | openssl base64` to the sha1 then compare it to stored one
    
- convert CERT.RSA from DER(binary) to PEM using `openssl`
    
    ```bash
    openssl pkcs7 -inform DES -print_certs -out cert.pem -in cert.rsa
    ## then to view details of pem
    openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -text
    ```
    
- CERT.SF: a list of the resources and their string line hashes from MANIFEST.MF. including MANIFEST.MF hash
    
    ![CERT.SF](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a5f02b70-3bb0-4a8d-8b29-c89252e4a3ec/Untitled.png)
    
    CERT.SF
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e32803a9-0332-4404-b5aa-4a25c486e051/Untitled.png)
    
- finally an APK must be aligned after it’s signed this done by using _`zipalign`_ from sdk/build-tools: _`zipalign -v 4 unaligned.apk aligned.apk`_
    

> we not sign the whole apk ? due to OTA(over the air) update files

> note that if the private key not protected, then game over
> 
> cuz if attacker get it he can release updates to the app, or even publish an app, and no way to stop it unless the compony sin new versions with different key(google paly store will treat it as a completely different app)

## App Components

[Activities](https://www.notion.so/Activities-3cb2fa3286dc4d919e095063010ac31c?pvs=21)

[Services](https://www.notion.so/Services-7080b1aeb7f741a1af501dacd10da905?pvs=21)

[**Content Providers**](https://www.notion.so/Content-Providers-f785761e8e024536b3d99a08cbdea7ea?pvs=21)

[Broadcaster Receiver](https://www.notion.so/Broadcaster-Receiver-7bd55a37f7674950a88d12a10a21e4d0?pvs=21)

### context

an Instances of the class `android.content.Context` provide the connection to the Android system which executes the application. Instance of Context is required to get access to the resources of the project and system resource: create view, service , or start new service

ex: Let's have an easy to digest example: Consider you are in a hotel, and you want to eat something. You call room- service and ask them to bring you things or clean up things for you. Now think of this hotel as an Android app, yourself as an activity, and the room-service person is then your context, which provides you access to the hotel resources like room-service, food items etc.

## Structure

1. java
    
    we all know that android use Java, end of story. so android is owned by Google(android developers) and Oracle(java).
    
    u can write android app by C, C++ but using Android Development Kit(NDK) is the best option
    
2. `AndroidManifest.xml`
    
    no android app can run without it as it defines things such App name, app components, app version, app UID, `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion` (which is an android version that app has been tested to be compatible with)
    
    > note that assign small number to `minSdkVersion` help to support more apps but keep in mind that this android oldest version have vulns that can be inherited by your app

## Android UI Layouts

Android Layout is used to define the user interface that holds the widgets that will appear on the screen of an android application or activity screen

Generally, every application is a combination of View and ViewGroup.

> _an android application contains a large number of activities and we can say each activity is one page of the application. So, each activity contains multiple user interface components and those components are the instances of the View and ViewGroup. All the elements in a layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects._

## Intents

Intents: are the primary way that Activity use to communicate with other Activities(external, and internal ones), services, and Broadcaster Receiver. it’s similar to HTTP methods in web

Intent commonly used to invoke action or set of action on the receiving components or apps

1. Implicit Intents: Intent that don’t specify a particular app component, but rather specify an **Action** to be taken in the received app
    
    > **Action** is a string value such as `ACTION_X` where `X` describe an action such `VIEW`or `SEND` , the action can be set by `setAction` fun or by `constractor`
    > 
    > ```java
    > Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND, Uri.Parse("mailto:"));
    > /**
    > * u can use **Extra** for carriy data into intent
    > * data could be primitive data types as well as arrays,
    > * Bundle and Parcelable data, **Serializable**.
    > */
    > intent.putExtra("EXTRA_DATA", "Some data!");
    > // then u can start the activivty
    > startActivity(intent);
    > ```
    
    > for app to receive our implicit intent, the receiving app’s mainfest must have a component with an _intent-filter_ which matches our **Action**
    > 
    > ```java
    > <activity android:name="ShareActivity">
    > 	<intent—filter> 
    > 		<action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
    > 		<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /> 
    > 	<intent—filter>
    > </activitY>
    > ```
    
    > The "_Intent resolution_" process queries the system's Package Manager process. It is used to **determine which apps are capable of handling the Intent** based on if they match the category, action and type. The resolution process also considers the priority attribute
    
    > (docs say priority attribute must be from 1000:-1000 but OS doesn’t force it and this allow apps to use `SYSTEM_HIGH PRIORITY`)
    > 
    > DRING THE PROCESS IF THERE ARE MORE T
    > 
    > if many apps can handle implicit intent, then android ask the user which app
    
2. Explicit Intents: intent that specify the class destination in the `constractor` , or by `setClass` , `setComponent` methods
    
    ```java
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, ShareActivity.class);
    ---- or
    Intent intent = new Intent();
    intent.setClassName("com.other.app","com.other.app.servername");
    context.startService(intent);
    ```
    
3. Broadcast intents
    
    Explicit Intents, Implicit Intents are received by only one app, Broadcast intents can be received by multiple apps.
    
    starting from API 14(android 4) u can select a received app using **`Intent.setPackage`**
    
    **Broadcast intents types:**
    
    1. Normal Broadcast: asynchronous and can be process by multiple apps in any order
    2. Ordered Broadcast: are run one at a time, in a daisy-chained fashion. the order is determined by the priority defined within the corresponding receiver component, within receiver’s `AndroidMainfest.xml` file
    
    after we know the types, how to send broadcast intent with a permission specified?
    
    > `sendBrodcast(intent, receiverPermission);`. note that unless the permission is reserved to system level apps; any app could declared the same permission and receive your broadcast
    
    what about if app use `sendBrodcast();` method from `LocalBroadCastManager` class?
    
    > then only app’s component can receive the broadcast without need to export a receive component
    
4. Sticky Broadcasts
    
    allow for data leakage/modification when received by a malicious apps
    
    any method have the “Sticky” word; like `sendStickyBroadcast`,mean that it’s a Sticky Broadcasts
    
5. Pending Intent
    
    allow other app to take action on behalf of your app, using app’s identity, and permissions.
    
    a wrong implementation can lead to vulns like `CVE-2014-8609`
    
    but why app may need to allow other app to take action on behalf of your app?
    
    > `PendingIntent` are most commonly used for notifications, app widgets, media browser services, let’s explain on notifications example
    > 
    > notifications is an android service which can’t be reimplemented/customized by every app want to use notification service, so an app can create instance from `PendingIntent` class with an intent, other flags. and send that instance to notification service. know once user interact with app’s notification, the notification system execute the intent (start the app, or do a custom action)
    
    what could go wrong?
    
    > If not implemented correctly, a malicious application can hijack a PendingIntent. For example, in the notification example above, a malicious application with `android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` can bind to the notification listener service and retrieve the pending intent. There are certain security pitfalls when implementing PendingIntents, which are listed below:
    > 
    > - Mutable fields: A PendingIntent can have mutable and empty fields that can be filled by a malicious application. This can lead to a malicious application gaining access to non-exported application components.
    > - Use of implicit intent: A malicious application can receive a PendingIntent and then update the base intent to target the component and package within the malicious application.
    
    A typical implementation for using `PendingIntent` is below:
    
    ```java
    Intent intent = new Intent(applicationContext, SomeActivity.class); // base intent 
    
    // create a pending intent 
    PendingIntent pendingIntent = 
    	PendingIntent.getActivity(applicationContext, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE); 
    /**
    * Using the PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE flag makes the 
    * PendingIntent immutable and prevents any changes to the fields.
    * since Android 12 (API level 31) PendingIntent is immutable by default.
    */
    
    // send the pending intent to another app 
    Intent anotherIntent = new Intent();
    anotherIntent.setClassName("other.app", "other.app.MainActivity"); 
    anotherIntent.putExtra("pendingIntent", pendingIntent); 
    startActivity(anotherIntent);
    ```

## Manifest file

an XML file that specifies all infos needed by android framework to run an app, infos like: the app name, icon, Java package name, version, declaration of Activities, Services, content provider, and app permissions, such as internet access,…

android staduio creates it dynamically, u don’t need to write it, here’s example of app that have one activity(`MainActivity`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="h...."
    package="com.example.helloworld">

    <application ....
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name">
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>

</manifest>
```

> You must declare all app components this way:
> 
> -`<activity>` elements for activities  
> -`<service>` elements for services -`<receiver>` elements for broadcast receivers -`<provider>` elements for content providers
> 
> Activities, services, and content providers that you include in your source but do not declare in the manifest are not visible to the system and, consequently, can never run. However, broadcast receivers can be either declared in the manifest or created dynamically in code (as `BroadcastReceiver` objects) and registered with the system by calling `registerReceiver()`.

let’s talk more about every **component**:

- **list of components**
    
    ```xml
    <manifest ...>
        <application ...>
            <activity android:name=".MainActivity" ...>
            </activity>
            <activity android:name=".JokeActivity" ...>
            </activity>
            <service android:name=".MyService" ...>
            </service>
        </application>
    </manifest>
    ```
    
- **Intent filter**
    
    When declaring an activity in your app's manifest, you can include intent filters that declare the activity's capabilities so that it responds to intents from other apps
    
    ```xml
    <activity android:name=".JokeActivity" ...>
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.ACTION_VIEW_JOKE" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
    ```
    
    in above example if app create intent with the action VIEW_JOKE and pass it to `startActivity()`,then our `JokeActivity` starts
    
    **Intent filter can have `uses-permission` to allow only app that have permission grant to start the app’s activity**
    
- **Min/target SDK**
    
    > when u develop an app u need to specify value of `targetSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion` which reflected in Gradle file, but first what’s api level?
    > 
    > - api level refer to the version of the android API that your app targets.
    >     
    > - Each android version associated with a specific api level, Android12⇒ API level 31.
    >     
    > - new version of android don’t remove the older APIs, cuz installed apps need them,
    >     
    > - `targetSdkVersion` the api level that the app is targeted to run on, set to least version allows you to access latest API features such 5G support
    >     
    > - `compiledSdkVersion` is the version of the API against which you compile your app
    >     
    > - `minSdkVersion` is the minimum api level required for run your app, used to prevent the application from being installed on devices that do not contain the features the application requires
    >     
    >     > note that developers make `minSdkVersion` small number to make there app run in older devices -business want to support widest range- . from security perspective it means that the app inherits the security vulns of that old version if developer fails to account for this in their application design
    >     
    
    ```xml
    <manifest ...>
        <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="23"
              android:targetSdkVersion="27" />
    </manifest>
    ```
    
    App can't run on devices with API level < 23 (Android 6.0) App can run on all version of Android >= 23 to latest one (29, Android 10) App has been designed and tested for API level 27 / Android 8.1
    
- **Permissions**
    
    permission defined by `uses-permission`, these prompts to the user in installation time, starting from android v6.0 users can control permission after installation, also some apps can run without grant permission and ask for it if needed.
    
    in old versions all permission was grant by one click throw on prompt, but in newest versions every permission have it’s own prompt view to the user
    
    `uses-permission` have tow attributes
    
    - `name`: could be
        - an android permission which begin with `android.permission`
        - or a custom permission defined in other app
    - `maxSdkVersion`: stops your app from asking permission on version higher than specified
    
    ```xml
    <manifest ...>
    		<!-- request internet permission --> 
    		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
        <!-- other permissions go here -->
    		<application>....</application>
    </manifest>
    ```
    
    ALERT_SCREEN
    
    BOOT
    
- **custom permissions** using `permission` element
    
    when app need to expose function/service or data from it’s own components, it need to define a custom permission, using `permission` element. then only apps grant that permission can access function/data
    
    `permission` has 3 attributes
    
    - name: string to identify the permission
    - protection-level: dictate how the permission are granted, have 4 types
        - Normal: used when no known threat, user not require to approve
        - Dangerous: access data or system function, require user’s approval
        - Signature: ensure that only apps signed with same certification, as the app exporting component can be granted permission without user approval. only org’s apps can access org’s functions/data
        - SignatureOrSystem: apps signed with same certification, or apps run with system-level access(not installed by user)
    - permission-group: allow s for grouping related permissions

## Deep Links

Deep links are URIs of any scheme that take users directly to specific content in an app. An app can set up deep links by adding intent filters includes a category with value `android.intent.category.BROWSABLE` on the Android Manifest and extracting data from incoming intents to navigate users to the correct activity.

**Android supports two types of deep links:**

- Custom URL Schemes, which are deep links that use any custom URL scheme, e.g. myapp:// (not verified by the OS).
- Android App Links (Android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher), which are deep links that use the http:// and https:// schemes and contain the autoVerify attribute (verify deep links based on a website URL explicitly registered by the developer).

**Assassinated Security issues**

- Deep Link Collision: Using unverified deep links allow other installed apps to declare and try to handle the same intent. Any arbitrary application can declare control over the exact same deep link belonging to another application.
- XSS or others: if the data carried in the deep link not verified before get used in a WebView

## AIDL, IPC , Binder

after we know about [Services](https://www.notion.so/Services-7080b1aeb7f741a1af501dacd10da905?pvs=21) there are service type called bound service

> A bound service is a java class extend the Android class `Service` and must implement the method `onBind()` that return `IBinder`, which is invoked when a client calls `bindService()`.
> 
> When a client app invokes the `bindService()` method of a service, that service is “bound” and available to provide client-server communication using either message passing or RPCs.
> 
> In the case of message passing, the `onBind()` method returns a Messenger service, which is used for sending messages/data from the client to the service.
> 
> To provide RPCs, the `onBind()` method must return an interface representing the methods in the remote object that clients use to interact with the service. This interface is written in regular Java syntax and uses the Android Interface Definition Language -AIDL- to create stub files, which serve as the client interface to remote services
> 
> implementation code example from [[AndroidNotesForProfessionals.pdf#page=380&selection=103,0,104,1|AndroidNotesForProfessionals, page 380]]

_**since execution of service starts from `onBind()` method, it should be our entry point when performing static analysis. then if app uses Messenger service trace the data may it’s sensitive on, if the app use RPC then review `.aidl` interface file**_

> The Android operating system has a rich set of IPC mechanisms contained in its binder framework, including RPCs that allow one process to request services from another process.
> 
> Google has added a new form of IPC known as Binder which is a kernel-level driver, moves the data from one process’s memory to another’s

## WebViews

are effective web browsers, which are embedded into Android apps, to render HTML, execute JS. WebView can load content from local template file, or pull from remote sites

WebViews may allow exploitation of client side web vulns such XSS, CSRF,.. but there are some limitations for the exploit

types

- `WebViewClient` simple HTML render, not run/display js `alert()` method, have there own cookies jar, without have access to app’s cookies or browser’s cookies by default
- `WebChrome client` full-fledged Chrom browser

WebView load content from URI using `loadURI`, `loadDate` ,`loadDataWithBaseURL` so make sure parameter passed to these method, not user-controlled, and sanitized

`WebSettings` object used to enable/disable WebView functionalities, here’s some security settings

- `setJavaScriptEnabled` to false cuz WebViews don’t require it. which prevent JS vulns such XSS
    
- JavaScript bridge functionality is a way to inject java object into WebView by making them accessible to JavaScript. after android 4.2 methods must be annotated with `@javascriptinterface` in order to be accessible to the JS running in the WebView
    
- WebView can access content providers view `content://` url and pass _true_ to `setAllowContentAccess`
    
- file system access by `fle://` , passing _false_ to `setAllowFileAccess` prevents access to the filesystem.
    
    `getAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs` , `getAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` methods take a single Boolean argument
    
- `setPluginState`
    

## Fragment

root is a process by which one obtains “root” or system level access to an android device

manufacturers doesn’t allow user to have this level of access. so they need to exploit a vuln in the device(may u need tow exploits: one to get unprivileged access, and a second to get root)

for access maintenance: copy `su` binary to a location specified in the user’s **PATH** env.. vars like(/system/xbin), then use APP to interface the command execution **`Runtime.exec()`**. (we put `su` in a place can be accessed by our APP like a the PATH that android use to search for binaries)

### rooting device can make some issues

most savvy users trust any app or tool in order to root their devices, even the developers of this apps not-malicious they can make mistakes that turn the device into paperweight and make it unusable. but if they are malicious then game over cuz u not only the one how get the root access

### custom rooms

some users replace OS that comes with their device with custom firmware. following are most used:

[LineageOS – LineageOS Android Distribution](https://lineageos.org/)

[OmniROM](https://omnirom.org/)

[XDA Portal & Forums](https://www.xda-developers.com/)

### implications of rooting

once u root a device, any exist app could request root access, and if malicious get that capability their is no limit for that app

### but we need root for our testing purposes u can use emulator(slow) or ADB, but it’s better to have Nexus device on hand

> _note that if u run ADB on emulator that have a google APIs u get shell as user note root, so to get root access in emulator install emulator without google apis_

u can follow video to get root over ADB

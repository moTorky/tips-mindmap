# intro

> Android is an open source OS based on Linux OS 2.6 kernel.

before u go on with this course make your self familre with Linux, and JAVA

each layer provide some functionalities, each layer relying on security of lower layers. but the device data and functionality need to be protected on multiple layers

# Android Architecture

- The **Applications layer** is where the individual applications you install and run, reside.
    
- The **Application Framework layer** exposes system APIs for common functionality by providing several important classes which are used to create an Android application. provide services to apps in the form of Java classes: content provider, activity manager, notification manager, view system, package manager etc. which are helpful for the development of our application according to the prerequisite.
    
    > Log class is android class implemented in java; used to log massages to the console, associate with massage tag. as a pentester this most simple way to extract data/flag from apps `Log.e("<TAG>","<msg>");`
    
    > if u don’t know about how XYZ API work, just ask google `"android <api-name>"`
    
- The **Libraries layer** contains C and C++ libraries which handle low-level processes, such as graphics drawing, network encryption, multimedia playback and image rendering, database support, SSL
    
    Java-based libraries that are specific to Android development, such `android.app`, `android.content`, `android.database`, `android.webkit`
    
- The **Android Runtime layer** represents the area of the OS where the VM responsible for running applications resides.
    
    These libraries consist of the following Java libraries:
    
    - Dalvik VM Specific Libraries: direct interaction with a Dalvik VM instance
        
        **Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)** is a register-based virtual machine and specially designed and optimized for android to ensure that a device can run multiple instances efficiently. It depends on the layer Linux kernel for threading and low-level memory management. The core libraries enable us to implement android applications using the standard JAVA or Kotlin programming languages.
        
    - Java Interoperability Libraries: a subset of standard Java Core Libraries adapted for use in the Dalvik VM
        
    - Android Libraries: libraries directly used in Android application development and responsible for most of the core functionality of applications
        
- The **Linux Kernel layer** is the underlying layer that ties all of the upper layers together. This layer arbitrates all access to the underlying device hardware, via device drivers. the kernel also handles memory, processes, threads, power management, Network Stack
    

# Android Virtual Machine

Android Virtual Machine: is the abstraction layer between Application and Android device.

> we know that JAVA apps are complied into platform independent: **D**alvik **EX**ecutable (DEX), or bytecode. then Android VM’s run the complied file.

> before KitKat(v.4.4) Android was use Dalvik VM. then from Lollipop(v.5.0) ART VM.
> 
> ART VM: add some new optimization features

> in Android Studio, apps are compiled into DEX or ODEX(Optimized DEX, used on apps that run at boot-time) bytecode. also u will hear about OAT files.

> most of android apps use java but it’s possible for use native code(C, C++,. ). which commonly used for high performance apps: games.
> 
> **BUT NATIVE CODE SUFFER FROM MEMORY CORRUPTION SUCH BOF**

# Android Security Model

there are 2 Android Security Model:

1. DAC (dictionary access control) implemented in the OS: isolate installed apps by using User-ID(UID) witch help to separate data and code execution, as every app have it’s own UID that assign to it on installation.
    
    > so once u install an app the android framework assign new UserID for it and give it a private directory(private storage), then the running process run under that UserID
    
    this prevent any app to access other app’s data unless root (in new version of android root can’t access any data he want ) or certain components of the OS
    
2. MAC (mandatory access control) implemented in the APP itself:
    
    1. allow for developers to expose certain apps.
        
    2. default denied unless there’s kernel say yes; even if u have root access
        
    3. configure app capabilities in-line with risk tolerance. [**Risk Tolerance**](https://www.notion.so/Risk-Tolerance-4c5edf4812e148d6ac9b2b314b93c036?pvs=21)
        
    4. implemented in the form of `SELinux` starting from Android 4.3, have 3 states,
        
        1. Enforced: don’t allow and log
        2. permissive: allow and log it
        3. disabled: don’t even log action
        
        3 types:
        
        1. Default: normal set by room creator, or android manifesto
        2. `mls` multi layer security: used in military product, have advanced security
        3. `src` set by developers
        
        get your Android `SELinux` state: `getenforce` cmd in ADB, `setenforce <state>` which require root access, and got reset to default after device rebooting
        

```bash
root@generic :/data/data # ls -ln
<permision> <UID> <GID> <date> <directory> # note that uid=gid and it's uniq for every app dir
```

### Shared ID

apps sign by same certificate can SharedUserID which mean share data files and process and sandbox.

to share same UID, apps must define the same `android.shareUserId` value in their manifests

### how none privileged app(normal app with it’s UserID) can run/call privileged service/app such getLocation()

- internal process communication (IPC)
- remote procedul call (RPC)
- Binder deriver

list of tools used for Reversing APKs: (Reversing mean get the source code from compiled files)

- `apktool d <apk>` this decode essential files (Manifest, images, layouts, strings,..) if this doesn’t generate `classes.dex` use `-s`. this can happened cuz of optimized dex(odex)
    
- `dex2jar` used to convert `.class` , `.dex` to `.jar` file → `d2j-dex2jar.sh classes.dex -o o.jar`
    
- `jd-gui` java decompiler allow u to browse source code(`.jar`)
    
    ![this numbers saved to R.layout, u can export all .java files by save all resources (shift+ctl+s)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/79aacfd7-ca2e-4110-8ffc-3a49efc6e6c2/Untitled.png)
    
    this numbers saved to R.layout, u can export all .java files by **save all resources (shift+ctl+s)**
    
    ```bash
    └─$ cp example.apk example.zip
    └─$ unzip example.zip
    └─$ ls
    AndroidManifest.xml  classes.dex  META-INF  res  resources.arsc
    └─$ ~/tools/dex2jar/dex2jar-2.0/d2j-dex2jar.sh classes.dex -o out_file.jar 
    # u can replace classes.dex with example.apk in order to get the .jar file
    └─$ ~/tools/dex2jar/dex2jar-2.0/d2j-dex2jar.sht example.apk –o output_file.jar
    then using jd-gui, bowser and open out_file.jar , then sift+ctl+s to get =>
     out_file.jar.src.zip 
    ```
    

## Smali/Backsmali

[Home](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/wiki)

those are disassembler used to convert bytecode(`.dex`) into `smali code`

get smali code from .dex :`java -jar ~/tools/dex2jar/dex2jar-2.0/baksmali-2.5.0.jar classes.dex`

get out.dex from smali: `java -jar ~/tools/dex2jar/dex2jar-2.0/smali-2.5.0.jar source/`

## obfuscation

Obfuscation is the process of intentionally making code harder to read for the purpose of making it more difficult to reverse. This is usually done by developers wanting to protect their intellectual property, namely the code itself, but it is also a side effect of optimizing and minifying(a generic term for reducing the size of the code) the code.

While it may make it harder to reverse an app, it doesn't guarantee any security, **at all,** against a determined reverser.

> `ProGuard` can be built-in to android studio’s built process, used for code optimization, and obfuscation. in android studio u can enable basic obfuscation by using minification in proguard. all u need is modify _build.gradle_ file

> investigate/understand an obfuscated APk is more harder, but u still can find hardcoded info

### OEM APPs (Original Equipment Manufacturer)

> OEM apps refer to the pre-installed applications that come with a device when you purchase it from the manufacturer. these apps can found in the `/system/app` dir on the device

There are essentially three sources for pre-installed apps:

- shipped with the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) ROM
- added by either your device manufacturer (OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer),
- and/or added by your cell phone provider, if the device was purchased from them.

> note that this app lead to some of the most impactful app-related vulns because of many of them run with system(root) permission
